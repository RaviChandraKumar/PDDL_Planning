TO DO:

design appropriate descriptions of facts, actions, and goals, using the PDDL language, for two planning problems



Param 1:	 file containing definitions of actions.

Param 2:	location of a text file containing definitions of facts about the environment, 
			including objects (and types for those objects), 
			general predicates that are always true, 
			initial state description, and 
			goal description


Note that the preconds in each fact file will contain both 
		statements that are always true in that domain
		and statements that simply describe the initial state for that specific planning problem			


create a separate text file that includes all the statements that must be present in ANY facts file for that domain.
